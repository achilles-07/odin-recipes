                            <h3>Buttered Noodles</h3>
                            <p>
                                Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.

                            <h3>Chana Masala</h3>
                            <p>
                                Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back. Indian food is not just curried sauces. This spin on an Indian chickpea curry features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all!

                            <h3>Garlic Onion Naan</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am going to show you how to make naan Chef John-styleâ€”when I want it fast and I don't want to use yeast and wait for a dough to rise but I also want it just as good as if I did. While I originally tried this method to save time, it produces what might be my favorite style of naan. It really is incredible whether you use garlic and green onions, or not. As naan are made, they must be stacked and wrapped in a kitchen towel to keep them soft and supple.

                            <h3>Pasta Roni</h3>
                            <p>
                                Call it a childhood craving, dorm room gourmet, or simply a grocery store pantry staple, but homemade angel hair pasta with herbs is just as tasty and fast to make! There's no denying the simplicity.

                            <h3>Spicy Thai Basil</h3>
                            <p>
                                My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.
